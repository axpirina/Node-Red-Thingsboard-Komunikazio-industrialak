# Node-RED Subflows

## Introduction

In this repository different Node-RED subflows can be found, to facilitate the accomplishment of basic tasks related to Industry 4.0.
Each subflow is available in its own folder with detailed instructions.

- [OPC UA Handler](./opc-ua-handler)
- [Send email](./send-email)
- [Timeseries2CSV](./timeseries2csv)


## Installation

All subflows can be installed in the same way, although some may depend on other modules.
In that case, the modules to be installed will be specified in the documentation of the subflow itself.
In general, the installation process is as follows:

- Go to the folder of the subflow to be installed:

![Subflow folder](./docs/subflow-folder.png "Subflow folder")

- Click on the .json file:

![Subflow JSON](./docs/subflow-json.png "Subflow JSON")

- Press the "Raw" button:

![Subflow RAW](./docs/subflow-raw.png "Subflow RAW")

- Right click on the text and download the file using the "Download as..." option:

![Subflow Save As](./docs/subflow-save-as.png "Subflow Save As")

- Within Node-RED, in the options menu (icon at the top right of the screen), choose the "Import" option:
